          <p>Primary campers delight in participating in an engaging and innovative program. Our play based program includes both indoor and outdoor learning opportunities.The day begins with an outdoor activity such as a nature walk, visiting one of two parks, yoga stretching or learning a new sport skill. Campers then enjoy their snacks and quiet time before embarking on a variety of activities indoors.</p>
          <p>This year, a "Loose Parts" learning opportunity to develop problem solving and inquiry skills using natural materials in creative ways will be introduced. Campers learn respect, initiative, responsibility and resilience as they create inspired artifacts that will be photographed and digitally archived as evidence of their work. In addition to this, art activities, board games and technology will be used to develop an environment where campers simultaneously learn and have fun.</p>
          <p>Time is carefully planned so that our young campers receive the best possible environment to develop their social, emotional and physical skills.</p>
