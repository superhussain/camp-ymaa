Campers are supported to pursue varied interesting, innovative and engaging experiences in a respectful and fun loving atmosphere.  Promotion of a balanced, healthy lifestyle that includes personal well being, kindness and caring for others, and eco friendly practices gives campers the opportunity to develop both intrapersonal reflection and interpersonal skills.  Activities building appreciation and awareness of the universal values of inclusion, collaboration and empathy, inquiry and problem solving foster a sense of community and camaraderie from the beginning of the day to the end. Come and share the joy with us @ The Best Camp Ever!</p>
