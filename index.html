      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Camp YMAA offers a spectacular day camp experience for children ages 4-12. Campers are supported to pursue varied interesting, innovative and engaging experiences in a respectful and fun loving atmosphere.  Promotion of a balanced, healthy lifestyle that includes personal well being, kindness and caring for others, and eco friendly practices gives campers the opportunity to develop both intrapersonal reflection and interpersonal skills.  Activities building appreciation and awareness of the universal values of inclusion, collaboration and empathy, inquiry and problem solving foster a sense of community and camaraderie from the beginning of the day to the end. Come and share the joy with us @ The Best Camp Ever!</p>

        <h3>Our Origin</h3>
        <p>It started with a child's desire to grow, a parent's desire to provide the opportunity, and a family's desire to work together in realizing a better future. This principal, existing simultaneously in all families, makes our origin a place we like to call "Home".</p>
        <p>Our family of volunteers, and partners came together, understanding the goal, each one contributing efforts that are both priceless and timeless, to help build something they would not only consider their own, but worth sharing with all those aspiring for a healthier lifestyle.</p>
