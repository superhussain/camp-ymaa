The activities were varied enough to keep his interest, and involve all aspects of learning. What's appreciated even more is that it strengthens the child's attachment to Muslim community, make Muslim friends and increases his religious knowledge, and applies the daily Islamic way of life, which is something that is deeply needed more than anything else these days. In addition to the usual activities of a camp, the involvement and participation in Muslim community, making Muslim friends at his age, and going through an Islamic daily routine including prayers and duas is extremely valuable and influential, especially at his age.",author:"Al Radif Family"},{text:"My son's experience at Camp was amazing.
